            Hi, again! It's your average mum of two with a passion for all things coding, here. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After deciding it was time for a career change, I discovered the world of coding and fell in love with it! 
            I started my coding journey in 2022 with Codecademy believing that I would be a profesional coder by the end of the course. Only to realise that you never really stop learning with coding and there are a plethora of languages to be learned and become proficient in. I can't wait!
            <br>
            <br>
            Take a little tour of my humble project portfolio created using everything I've learnt so far in Codecademy. I aim to update it throughout with new codes and show off my new skills.
